  - rscadd: "Added a Standard Bearer subclass to MAA, there can only be one. They spawn with the Ducal Standard, a special spear which buffs them, and allows them to rally the garrison's forces."
  - bugfix: "Checking the force of a wielded weapon will now show you the actual force, and not the unwielded force."
