  Ollanius:
  - rscadd: The 'ENDURE' miracle now prints a uniquely-colored emote upon casting,
      instead of forcing the caster to shout.
  - rscadd: Slightly tweaked the verbage on the emotes that 'PRAYER', 'RESPITE', and
      'PERSIST' print upon completion.
  - rscadd: Triumph-costing items in the loadout menu. You can now spend these points
      on a variety of mechanically-altered goods, ranging from fancy clothes and adventuring
      equipment to ornate jewelry and reskinned variants of the steel longsword.
  - rscadd: Adds a new tier of equipment, 'Gold', for smithing. While legendarily
      difficult to smith, these pieces are unrivaled in terms of glamour. It's said
      that they're extremely strong, but also extremely fragile and heavy; a perfect
      compliment to the Lord.
  - rscadd: Adds a new tier of equipment, 'Bronze', for smithing. Bronze is harder
      to get than Iron, but - as a Novice-tier alloy - can be worked by even unskilled
      hands. It can be considered a unique sidegrade, and sometimes an outright upgrade,
      to Iron.
  - rscadd: Adds Bronze-tier versions of the hammer, tongs, thresher, pitchfork, hoe,
      sickle, chisel, handsaw, shovel, fishing rod, pot, frying pan, goblet, platter,
      mug, spoon, fork, ring, statue, and lamptern.  Stronger, sharper, and better
      than their Iron variants.
  - rscadd: Adds the Bronze Khopesh, Gladius, Warclub, Flail, and Dolabra. The Warclub
      is a warhammer (all credit to Terracotta from Vanderlin!), and the Dolabra is
      a special axe-pick combitool. Decorated versions of both the Gladius and Warclub
      can be made.
  - rscadd: Adds the Bronze Arrow, Bolt, Sling Bullet and Siegebolt. Besides the standard
      variance in damage and penetration, these munitions are also exceptionally fast-flying,
      and have an increased damage multiplier against NPCs.
  - rscadd: Adds the Bronze Barbute, Neckguard, Gorget, Wristguards, Skirt, Greaves,
      and Hoplon Shield. While its protection is comparatively poor - on par with
      copper, its durability supersedes steel and provides protection against all
      critical hit types.
  - rscadd: Adds the Ancient Bascinet and Ancient Kettle.
  - rscadd: Adds the Broadswords; a variant of the Longsword that loses its one-handed
      cuts and some defense in favor of one-handed chops. Comes in three flavors -
      iron (the default), steel (higher sharpness), and bronze.
  - rscadd: 'Adds the Rondel Dagger (based off of KittySmooch''s Training Dagger),
      a steel dagger subgrade that has slightly higher defense and the ''rapid thrust''
      intent: half the AP, half the clickdelay. Ideal as an anti-grappling or gap-exploiting
      weapon.'
  - rscadd: Reincarnates the Baurenwehr as an iron-bladed combat knife, and a pseudo-upgrade
      to the Hunting Knife.
  - rscadd: 'Introduces the Siegebow, a heavy crossbow equivalent that fires massive
      bolts: fit for sundering defenses at range. A master engineer can craft its
      components. A certain Grenzelhoftian and Deadite subclass can take one. Thanks
      to ProbablyCarl!'
  - rscadd: Silver variants of the Necran, Astratan, and Undivided amulets. An Exorcist's
      faith will now determine what variant they spawn with, though more can always
      be bought through the silverface. Golden amulets of Zizo and Astrata now float
      around..
  - rscadd: Back from Roguetown IE is the classic steel armor line, under the 'Valorian'
      prefix. It is just as good as regular steel armor, and is available either through
      smithing or importation.
  - rscadd: Silver arrows, bolts, and heavy bolts. Their damage and penetration is
      unrivaled, but their cost is prohibitive. Perhaps the Inquisition might know
      more about them..
  - rscadd: Adds the stockless crossbow, which can be hatcheted by an Artificer. It
      can be reloaded on the move and stowed in a particularly large place, but suffers
      from a heavier loss to accuracy and reload-speed.
  - rscadd: 'New scabbard and sheath variations: silver (which spawns on most noble
      roles) and gold (which strictly accompanies royalty). They can double as lesser,
      parry-capable versions of the Kazengunite scabbard. Upgrade your scabbard at
      a smith!'
  - rscadd: New sprites added to the bone axe, bone spear, laborer's knife, and an
      assortment of rings. Many more sprites are now available in the code's .dmis,
      for future coders to fiddle with. Thanks to Chaoko and Spooky!
  - rscadd: Mailled hauberk, which can be made by combining a matching set of hauberk-and-a-cuirass
      at a table. It has the protection of chainmaille, but with moderately increased
      durability.
  - rscadd: Adventuring classes can now take the Greatflail, a polearm-flail with
      surprising reach and lethality. Smithable as well.
  - rscadd: Sharpened stakes can now be made with a stake and whetstone, unlocking
      additional intents and letting it scale to the Knife skill. At a master smith's
      anvil, this can be combined with two silver ingots to make a silver-tipped stake.
  - rscadd: '''Berserker''s Sword'', a special variant of the Executioner Sword. It
      can deliver one-handed chops, or a two-handed cleave: a more damaging version
      of the mace''s Smash intent with reduced knockback.'
  - rscadd: Stylish bolt pouches, which can hold a standard of sixteen rods. They're
      uniquely available through leatherworking-slash-stitching.
  - rscadd: Lyches now spawn with the Ominously Enchanted garb, which provides gambeson-tier
      protection on the mask-and-cloak spots.
  - rscadd: Steel sling bullets! The best of the best. They don't come cheap, though;
      better make your shots count.
  - rscadd: A variant of the golden mask, bereft of its prominent forehead-fin.
  - rscadd: Added on-mob sprites for all patron amulets, and touched up some preexisting
      ones. Includes unique on-mobs for when they're worn on the wrist slot as well!
  - rscadd: Orles to the Bascinet and the Hounskull - the old Pigface, not the new
      one. Give them a try!
  - rscadd: White tabards and shrouds, accessible in the loadout, for the dying hand.
  - balance: Blacksteel arming swords now deal 25-30 damage, over the original vaues
      of 24-27.
  - balance: Overhauled the Marquette's stock. Some items cost more and now have limited
      stock, while others are now cheaper.
  - balance: The Marquette now stocks slightly more vials, and a variety of blastpowder-peppered
      surprises.
  - balance: The crafting recipe for the Monk's Headband now generates the far less
      strong Hunter's Headband.
  - balance: The Monk's Headband now has a seperate recipe, requiring additional cloth.
  - balance: Most silver items in the game - save for actual silver weapons, ammunition,
      and necklaces - no longer blight the undead. This is to make Lyckers far less
      easy to reveal, without some effort. Should be reworked, later on.
  - balance: All crossbows now deal integrity damage on their melee strikes, and have
      slightly more melee force.
  - balance: Reduced the damage of the Poop Knife. Do not ask about the ash.
  - balance: Knife sheaths can now be worn on the wrist slot, and waterskins can now
      fit on the back slot.
  - balance: Golden circlets can now be worn as overlays on the mask slot.
  - balance: Ancient Legionnaires can now pick between two armor loadouts - the sayovard
      and cuirass + hauberk, or the bascinet and a set of heavier hauberk.
  - bugfix: Guidesa's work - characters will no longer use telekinesis to wield most
      hammers, tongs, and picks.
  - bugfix: Swords based off the 'Judgement', including the 'Ichor Fang', now properly
      look wielded when two-handed.
  - bugfix: Nurse veils will now show up when worn on the mask slot, instead of being
      mysteriously invisible.
  - bugfix: A lot of minor spelling fixes, format-tweaks, and errant space removals.
  - bugfix: Readds missing sheath sprites for Elvish weaponry.
  - bugfix: Changed the hexcode of Leather Bracers to make it look much closer to
      its original counterpart.
  - bugfix: Redid the shading on multiple Ancient and Bronze weapons.
  - bugfix: Turned the Stone Sling Bullet's sprite into an actual stone, and added
      a proper projectile sprite as well.
  - bugfix: Added a proper version of the extremely rare Barbute's icon, as it turns
      out that you can actually get it in game. Thanks, Spear!
  - code_imp: Added a lot of unused content in the .dmis for future coders to code,
      largely in the weapon- and misc-centric .dmi files.
  - code_imp: A complete 'royal' variant of the golden equipment line is prepared
      for deployment. New Duke stuff, perhaps?
  - code_imp: Tidied up a handful of .dmis related to ammo and sleeves, in order to
      make future navigation a little easier for others.
  - code_imp: Removed Zerobrine.
