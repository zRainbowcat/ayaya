      won''t be hitting anything.'

      with patron-specific robes and tabards.
  - bugfix: Templar!Monks no longer spawn without their specialized gloves.
  - code_imp: Note - this fix is mostly a bandaid, as I couldn't find any other way
      to restore the glove-giving component without potentially rewriting the Templar!Monk's
      loadout code. If you pick 'Unarmed Discipline', it'll give you the better gloves
      as an item.
  - code_imp: For Templar!Monks, the Ravox-specific buff has been changed to use 'H.adjust_skillrank_up_to'.
      Everything'll still work exactly the same as before, but it'll prevent someone
